PROBLEM 1:

	1. Lists all visable files in the navigated directory.
	2. Lists all visable and hidden files in the current and previous directories separated by name.
	3. This command will delete all files and directories without being able to recover them.

PROBLEM 2:
	
	1. use "ls -t"
	2. use "cat -n (filename)"
	3. "whatis" searches the manual page names and displays the manual page descriptions of any name
       matched.

PROBLEM 3:
	
	1. apple
	2. banana - ">" writes in the file, overwriting anything already inside if the file already exists.
	3. banana
	   carrot - ">>" makes a new line and writes more into the file, saving what already exists, rather than overwriting like ">" does.
	4.       1       7      14 - "|" allows the user to use another function in tandem with the same input without making a new line.
